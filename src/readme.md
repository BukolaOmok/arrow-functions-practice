# Arrow function exercises

## Task 1 - convert functions to arrow functions

1.  install dependencies with `yarn`
2.  make sure all the tests pass (`yarn test`) - it's important to do this _before_ making changes!

3.  for each javascript file in the folder `src/conversion` whose name starts 01-09 (except the "test" files):
    -   re-write each function as an arrow function
    -   try to use the most concise form of arrow function syntax possible
    -   run the tests again (`yarn test`) to check the rewrite of that function has not broken things

## Task 2 - recognise arrow functions

-   Precisely identify ALL arrow functions in `src/identification/spotTheArrowFunctions.js`
-   Count them: you should get 7
